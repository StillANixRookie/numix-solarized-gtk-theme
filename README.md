### About this fork

This is a fork of the Numix GTK theme that replaces the colors of the theme and icons to use the solarized theme with a solarized green accent color.
This theme supports both the dark and light theme, just as Numix proper.

## Contributing to this fork

Just open an issue or make a PR. You don't have to strictly follow the Numix guidelines, as upstream will probably not care about this fork.
Changes other than fixing colors to be more solarized are not supposed to be committed here. Use the upstream repo for that.

What follows is the original README from the Numix project.

### Manual installation

First, you need to compile the theme using the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) compiler.

To install Sass, install Ruby and the gem command using your distribution's package manager. Then install `sass` with the `gem` command,

`gem install sass`

You'll also need the following commands in your path to generate the gresource binary. Install them using your distribution's package manager.

* `glib-compile-schemas`
* `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata`

After installing all the dependencies, switch to the cloned directory and, run the following in Terminal,

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

To set the theme in GNOME, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Numix"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme "Numix"
```

To set the theme in Xfce, run the following commands in Terminal,

```sh
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Numix"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Numix"
```

### For contributors
Start by reviewing the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### For developers
If you want to hack on the theme, make sure you have the `inotifywait` command available, which is used for watching and automatically building the files.

To start watching for changes, run the following,

```sh
make watch
```

If you change any assets, you'll need to regenerate the `gtk.gresource.xml` and `gtk.gresource` files. You can use [grrr](https://github.com/satya164/grrr) to do it easily.

GTK+ 3.18 or above
